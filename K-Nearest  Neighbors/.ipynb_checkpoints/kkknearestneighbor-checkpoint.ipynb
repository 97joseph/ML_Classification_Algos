    "6. kNN (k- Nearest Neighbors)\n",
    "It can be used for both classification and regression problems. \n",
    "However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. \n",
    "K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors. \n",
    "The case being assigned to the class is most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function.\n",
    "\n",
    "These distance functions can be Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski and Hamming distance. \n",
    "First three functions are used for continuous function and fourth one (Hamming) for categorical variables. \n",
    "If K = 1, then the case is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor. \n",
    "At times, choosing K turns out to be a challenge while performing kNN modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN can easily be mapped to our real lives. If you want to learn about a person, of whom you have no information, you might like to find out about his close friends and the circles he moves in and gain access to his/her information!\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to consider before selecting kNN:\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is computationally expensive\n",
    "Variables should be normalized else higher range variables can bias it\n",
    "Works on pre-processing stage more before going for kNN like an outlier, noise removal"
