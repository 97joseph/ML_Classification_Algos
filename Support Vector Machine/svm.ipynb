    "4. SVM (Support Vector Machine)\n",
    "It is a classification method. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we only had two features like Height and Hair length of an individual, weâ€™d first plot these two variables in two dimensional space where each point has two co-ordinates (these co-ordinates are known as Support Vectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will find some line that splits the data between the two differently classified groups of data. This will be the line such that the distances from the closest point in each of the two groups will be farthest away.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM2\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the tuning parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel-\n",
    "The learning of the hyperplane in a linear SVM is done by transforming the problem using some linear algebra.This is where the kernel plays role.\n",
    "Polynomial and exponential kernels calculates separation line in higher dimension.This is called the kernel trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization\n",
    "For large values of this parameter ,the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly\n",
    "Conviniently , a very small value of it will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane,even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma\n",
    "The gamma parameter defines how far the influence of a single training set reaches.With low gamma,points far away from the possible separation are considered in calculation for the separation line.Where as high gamma means the points close to possible line are considered in calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin\n",
    "A margin is a separation of line to the closest class points.\n",
    "A good margin is one where this separation is larger for both classes.It allows the points to be in their respective classes without crossing to other classes\n"
